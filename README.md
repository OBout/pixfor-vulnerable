This is an app written for my PhoneGap Day US 2016 "Privacy and Security Workshop"

It is terrible code riddled with security vulnerabilities.

#### API Server

To set up the server:

`cd server && npm install`

Then to run it:

`npm run`

There is also:

`npm restart`, `npm stop`, and `npm list`

#### PhoneGap app

`cd app` 

`phonegap add ios` (or android, though this only has an iOS "theme")

Then to run it:

`phonegap serve` (to use in the PhoneGap Developer App)

or

`phonegap run ios` (or android...)
